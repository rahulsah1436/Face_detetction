# Face_detetction

## Prerequisites
- 1.Numpy

## Before Execution

- 1.Make a folder inside which create subfolders(as many as you want) with specific name (For example : "s1","s2"
,...).This is done inorder to extract labels while training model with images.
- 2.Place images inside the subfolders (In one subfolder you need to place images of one person )

Haar Cascade Classifier needs thousands of images for getting accurate result.
